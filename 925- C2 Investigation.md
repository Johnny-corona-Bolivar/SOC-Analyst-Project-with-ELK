# Investigate Mythic Agent

**How to identify a C2 attack:**  
It can usually be identified through **network telemetry**. A C2 session will have **high and constant network traffic**.

**Process creation usually linked with network activity:**  
- Example: `RUNDLL32` â†’ Check if there is a **parent process** creating it.  
- Verify if there are **outgoing connections** (PowerShell, etc.) to **public IPs**.

If we have **Sysmon telemetry**, always check the **Process GUID** for correlation.  
The **Process GUID** will evaluate all events generated from the selected session (e.g., PowerShell).

**Observe:**  
- `event.action`  
- `event.code`  
- Messages: hash  

We will look for **file creation** and verify the **Process GUID**.  
Also check `processId` and `parentProcessId`, and look for any processes related to them.


Try to create new telemetry, but the **EDR detects it as malware** and automatically removes it.

Go to **Discover** and verify that we have the alert showing that the **Elastic EDR quarantined the file**.
