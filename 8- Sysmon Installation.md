# Sysmon Installation on a Cloud Windows Server



We are going to install Sysmon on our Windows Server created in the cloud.  
To do so, we will connect via **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)** from our local computer.

And then we have to go to the internet find the Sysmon page and download the exe from Sysmon

We have to download and extract the file.  
Sysmon always requires a configuration file to work.  

**I used GitHub - olafhartong/sysmon-modular: A repository of sysmon configuration modules**
