# Introdution to ELK

As we mentioned before, I will use ELK for this project. Let‚Äôs start with a brief summary of what ELK is.

**ELK** is an acronym that refers to a set of three open-source tools that work together to collect, process, search, analyze, and visualize data‚Äîespecially system logs and events.

üì¶ **ELK Stack** stands for these following tools.

1. **E ‚Äì Elasticsearch**  : Its a search and data analytics engine that Indexes and allows for fast searching of large volumes of information.  
   - Example: finding all failed login attempts among millions of records.  

2. **L ‚Äì Logstash**  : Its a tool for processing and transforming data before sending it to Elasticsearch and  Can receive data from different sources (servers, networks, applications) and normalize it.  
   - Example: converting a plain-text log into a structured JSON format.  

3. **K ‚Äì Kibana**  Its a visualization platform that Allows the creation of dashboards, charts, and alerts with the data stored in Elasticsearch.  
   - Example: displaying in a chart the number of connections from suspicious IP addresses.

üîç **Purpose of the ELK Stack**  
It is used to centralize logs and analyze them in real time. It is widely used for application monitoring, error detection, and also in cybersecurity as a base for SIEM solutions (for example, Wazuh uses ELK to display security data).

üõ† **Workflow of ELK**:  
1. Logstash receives logs from a firewall and transforms them into a common format follow its  
2. Sends them to Elasticsearch, which indexes them for fast searching and lastly  
3. Kibana displays on a dashboard how many brute-force attacks were detected today.

   ### Telemetric:

   - There are two popular to collect telemetric: **Beats and elastic agent**
     - Beats: 
         - File beats ‚Äì logs
         - Metric beats ‚Äì metrics
         - Packet beats ‚Äì network data
         - Winlog beat ‚Äì Windows events
         - Audit beat ‚Äì Audit data
         - Heartbeat beat ‚Äì uptime monitoring

Depending of the telemetric to collect, you install the correspondant beats in the endpoint: for this project i will use a FLEET SERVER

### Benefits of using elk:

1-	Centralized logging: meet compliance requirements & search data

2-	Flexibility: customized ingesti√≥n

3-	Visualizations: observe information at-a-glance

4-	Scalability: easy to configure to handle larger environments

5-	Ecosystem: many integration and rich community
