# Brute Force Attack?

A brute force attack is a hacking method that attempts to guess passwords or other access credentials by trying all possible character combinations until the correct one is found. It is a basic but effective technique, especially against weak passwords or poorly protected systems.

## Types of Brute Force Attacks

- **Simple brute force attack:** Uses all possible combinations to gain access.  
- **Dictionary attack:** Uses a wordlist containing commonly exposed passwords.  
- **Credential stuffing:** These attacks occur because many users reuse the same username/password combination across multiple sites.  

## How to Protect Yourself from a Brute Force Attack

- **Long passwords or passphrases:** Use 15+ characters, including uppercase letters and special characters (consider a password manager or passphrase).  
- **Multifactor authentication (MFA):** Always use an authenticator.  
- **Stay vigilant:** Monitor for suspicious activity and unauthorized access attempts.  

### Company Security Checklist

- **Publicly Available Assets:**  
  What assets are publicly available? Should they be? Review and limit exposure if unnecessary.

- **Services Exposure:**  
  Check if services like **SSH** or **RDP** are exposed to the Internet.  
  If they are, **stop it immediately** to prevent unauthorized access.
