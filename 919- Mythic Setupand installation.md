# Setup Mythic C2 Server and Learn How Mythic Works  

The server is installed in the same way as before in our Vultr   

Once **Mythic** is installed, we connect via **SSH**, update the repositories, and start preparing the environment.  
Since we need **Docker**, we will proceed with its installation.

### Clone the Mythic Repository  

We will clone the repository to be used from GitHub:  

    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic

After cloning the repository, we go to the **Mythic** directory.  
Since we will be using Docker, we need **mythic_docker**.  

     ```bash
     cd Mythic
     ./mythic_docker.sh

Inside the **Mythic** directory, we run the following command to build and set up Mythic with Docker:  

     ```bash
        make

At this point, you can already **log in** to the Mythic C2 server.  
Access the web interface using the serverâ€™s IP address and the configured credentials.

Remember to allow the 7443 port

The password is located in the **.env** archive of Mythic.  
It is a hidden file, so you need to use the following command to list it:  

        ```bash
           ls -la

## OPTIONAL

Now, we create a **firewall** to allow incoming connections only from specific servers, instead of allowing access from the entire internet.  

This helps secure the Mythic C2 server by restricting unauthorized access.

Next, we add the **Mythic server** to the firewall rules.  
This ensures that only the Mythic server and authorized hosts can access the environment
