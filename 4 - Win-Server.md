# Windows server creation

### Diagram modification

 - To create the Windows server, since if someone tries to compromise my Windows server, they would not have access to anything else in the entire VPC.

### The process of creating the Windows server is the same as the previous server:  
- Deploy â†’ Deploy New Server  
- Choose type: Will be shared CPU  
- Location: the same as the previous one  
- Select the hardware you want with the necessary capacity  
- The software will be Windows (I chose 2022)

- The only difference from the previous one is that, as specified in the diagram, it will not be inside the VPC, so it is not selected.

And we expose RDP to the internet to later monitor the traffic.
